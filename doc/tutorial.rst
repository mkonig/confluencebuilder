Tutorial
========

.. note::

    Advanced users of Sphinx can skip this section and view
    :doc:`configuration options <configuration>` available to prepare their
    documentation.

After :doc:`installing <install>` Atlassian Confluence Builder for Sphinx, a
Sphinx project can be configured to use supported :doc:`builders <builders>`.
The following tutorial will provide a series of steps which will:

* Enables a user to generate Confluence-compatible markup documentation.
* Enables a user to publish to a Confluence instance.

New documentation
-----------------

If a user is starting a new Sphinx-based documentation, the following steps can
be used to create a new minimalistic Sphinx configuration or use Sphinx's
quick-start utility. If attempting to use this extension for existing
documentation, start `configuring for this extension <configure_extension_>`_.

Quick-start
^^^^^^^^^^^

If opting for the quick-start utility, open a terminal to the location where
documentation should be generated (typically, an empty directory) and invoke the
following:

.. code-block:: shell

    sphinx-quickstart
     (or)
    python -m sphinx.cmd.quickstart
     (or)
    python -m sphinx.quickstart

After completing the quick-start, ``conf.py`` can be tweaked as desired.
Continue preparing the documentation by
`configuring for this extension <configure_extension_>`_.

Minimalistic
^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a minimalistic setup, create a new folder for the new documentation and
configuration to be used. This is done by first creating a document named
``index.rst`` with the following content:

.. code-block:: rst

    My documentation
    ================

    This is a test document.

Next, create a configuration file ``conf.py`` with the following information:

.. code-block:: python

    extensions = []

After preparing these files, continue by
`configuring for this extension <configure_extension_>`_ as follows.

.. _configure_extension:

Configuring to use this extension
---------------------------------

Enable this extension by registering the extension in the target project's
Sphinx configuration (``conf.py``):

.. code-block:: python

    extensions = [
        'sphinxcontrib.confluencebuilder',
    ]

Next, include a series of publish-related settings to the configuration file:

.. code-block:: python

    confluence_publish = True
    confluence_space_key = 'TEST'
    confluence_ask_password = True
    # (for Confluence Cloud)
    confluence_server_url = 'https://example.atlassian.net/wiki/'
    confluence_server_user = 'myawesomeuser@example.com'
    # (or, for Confluence Data Center)
    confluence_server_url = 'https://intranet-wiki.example.com/'
    confluence_server_user = 'myawesomeuser'

Make appropriate changes to the above configuration for the environment being
targeted.

.. note::

    The configuration of the space key (:lref:`confluence_space_key`) is
    case-sensitive. Ensure the value matches the case found on the Confluence
    instances (typically, uppercase).

Recommended configurations
--------------------------

By default, this extension will publish any documents to the root of a
configured space. It can be common for most users to want to publish a
documentation set as children of an already existing page. To take advantage of
this feature, a user will want to define a :lref:`confluence_parent_page`
option in their configuration file. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    confluence_parent_page = 'MyDocumentation'

When publishing a documentation set, the above configuration will tell this
extension to publish all documents under the ``MyDocumentation`` page.

For first time users, they may wish to sanity check what content will be
published before publishing for the first time to a Confluence instance. A user
can perform a dryrun by configuring the :lref:`confluence_publish_dryrun`
option in the project's configuration file. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    confluence_publish_dryrun = True

For more information on the above or additional configuration options, see
:doc:`all configuration options <configuration>`.

Building/publishing documentation
---------------------------------

To process and publish the documentation set, invoke Sphinx with the
``confluence`` builder (or a desired :doc:`builder <builders>`) to perform
building/publishing:

.. code-block:: shell

    make confluence
     (or)
    sphinx-build -M confluence . _build -E -a
     (or)
    python -m sphinx -M confluence . _build -E -a

Documentation of the project should now be published to the Confluence site.

For users who set the dryrun option above (:lref:`confluence_publish_dryrun`),
they may inspect the output of the run to confirm what the publish event will
perform. If the desired result is observed, a user can remove the dryrun option
and re-invoke the build/publish command to publish onto the configured
Confluence instance.
